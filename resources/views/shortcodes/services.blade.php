                    <p>Decentralized digital currency systems known as cryptocurrencies are a breakthrough in electronic payments: the absence of a central authority can avoid the risk that a not fully reliable, very small transactions can be made without incurring high costs and transactions can be traced. Furthermore, decentralization provides robustness against many attacks.</p>

                            <p>Smart contracts go beyond the vending machine in proposing to embed contracts in all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means. Smart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, often proactively enforced form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactive measures must fall short.In a nutshell, the idea behind Smart Contracts is to use programs to enforce the clauses of a contract, and cryptography to ensure non-tampering, transparency and fraud protection. At pyrupay we help you develop smart contract which can be as simple as a set of promises agreed by two or more parties.</p>
